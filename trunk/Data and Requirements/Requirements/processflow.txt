process flow;

-Each student goes to the exam centers page to register for exams.

-The student goes to the centers page and puts in his country name to see available centers

-if the student finds a center close to him he notifies the center manager 

-the center manager checks the centers database and gets the proctor information.

-the center manager notifies the student of the approval to use the center and the proctor contact details for further correpondence between the student and the proctor

-if the student does not find any suitable center nearby he notifies the manager of a proposed center with full contact details of the center( probably of even who to get in touch with)

-the manager gets a notice of a  proposed center with the contact details and a mail is sent to the center to seek their consent while the student is also cc'd on all correspondences

-if the center is approved by the manager based on the responses via mail the center is listed as approved and the student is mailed accordingly

--the center is then mailed with details of exam dates

-the center is also mailed to provide the proctors information in a format stipulated

-the student(s) is/are then informed that they are to contact the center to make further arrangements

-if there are communication gaps between the manager and the proposed center then more follow-up mails are sent(and the student is also cc'd).Some other forms of communication can be used if the center does not respond ontime

-if the center is found unresponsive, the student is mailed and asked to look for another center

-if the center is found unsuitable.it does not become  approved

-Approved centers are then mailed the names of students who have chosen the centeras their exams venue along with the exam passwords(or later in the case of paswords)

- A centers' view is provided for the manager to see the status of the centers

-A students' view is also provided for the manager to see all students who have applied to take exams and their status with regards to the center(and maybe exams)
